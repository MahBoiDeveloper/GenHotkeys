# Tech Tree File Format

The tech tree for Generals Zero Hour is built from the information in the `TechTree.json` file, rather than from the game`s ini files, due to the simplification of information retrieval and data loading.

The tech tree description file is a JSON structure containing a list of factions called `TechTree`, each of which consists of the following fields: `ShortName`, `DisplayName`, `DisplayNameDescription`, and the following lists: `Buildings`, `Infantry`, `Vehicles`, `Aircraft`. Each element in these lists is also a structure with fields `Name` (defines which .webp file should be loaded from the `Resources\Icons` directory), `IngameName` (defines which string from the .csf file should be taken as the object name) and a list of lists `KeyboardLayouts`. These layouts represent the possible combinations of the GUI for a unit or building. Each element in a layout is a structure with two fields: `IconName` (which defines which .webp file should be loaded from the `Resources/Icons` directory) and `HotkeyString` (which defines which string from the .csf file should be used for the hotkey of the action).

Example:

```json

    "TechTree" : 
    [
        {
            "ShortName"               : "USA",

            "DisplayNameDescription"  : "United Stated Of America",

            "Buildings" : 
            [
